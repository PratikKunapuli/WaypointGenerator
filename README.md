# WaypointGenerator
Python program written to visually create waypoints on an image using the wx library. Used in conjunction with the Trajectory Library for autonomous movements in the 2017 FRC game, FIRST Steamworks. This program works with a top-down image of the field and when a user clicks the path they want the robot to take, the waypoints are gereated and printed to the console.
